## Adele Discord FAQ Bot 

When users ask questions in the Discord that have been aligned in the existing FAQ, they receive a role stating they have not read it. This removes their immediate access to the rest of the Discord Server but still allows them access to the FAQ. When a member receives the role 
and loses access to the server they're followed up by the bot to message them why they lost access. 

Future Implementations? 
- Figure out why users who are not approved are getting auto-kicked out from the server
- Users who have the did not read FAQ role have an option of getting repermitted into the server
- Put all the people who did not read the faq into their own channel
